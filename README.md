# Vanilla Typescript with Website template
To make html, css pages with Typescript.

Created this project because of the current problem with webpack.config.ts I was having with the
vanilla project boilerplate.
```javascript
TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension ".ts" for ./webpack.config.ts
```
